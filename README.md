# Notes on the FLORIS toolbox
-------------------------------

This FLORIS model is designed to provide a computationally inexpensive, controls-oriented model of the steady-state wake characteristics in a wind farm.  This can be used for online optimization.  This version of FLORIS implements a 3D version of the Jensen, original FLORIS (Gebraad et. al. 2016), and Gaussian wake model.  Literature on the Gaussian model can be found in the following papers:

To Run:
--------
Open RunGAUSS_3D.ipynb - this notebook contains 5 examples of how to use this FLORIS code:

	1. Extract Velocity and Power information

	2. Visualize the wind farm in the horizontal plane using different wake models

	3. Wake steering optimization (objective of power maximization)

	4. Thrust optimization (objective of power maximization)

	5. Visualize Lidar module based on the University of Stuttgart scanning Lidar

	6. Extract velocities at specified points in the field


**Note: a detailed inputData dictionary is necessary to run the code.  This is detailed in RunGAUSS_3D.ipynb
